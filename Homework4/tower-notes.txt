Running my speedup function gives me the following:

T = 1.5 ? ;

When running the following:
?- ambiguous(N, C, T1, T2)
I get the following results:
C = counts([4,2,2,1],[1,2,2,4],[4,2,2,1],[1,2,2,4])
N = 4
T1 = [[1,2,3,4],[2,1,4,3],[3,4,1,2],[4,3,2,1]]
T2 = [[1,2,3,4],[2,4,1,3],[3,1,4,2],[4,3,2,1]] ?
