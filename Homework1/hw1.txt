    Due to their trivial definitions, I will only be explaining number 7 (filter_reachable)
    
    The main issue with this problem is finding the reachable nonterminal elements. This is performed
using the symbols_reach function. This function uses the previously made functions (compute_fixed_point
and equal_sets) along with an auxilary function that removes all terminal elements from the list to
provide me with the list I need to continue this problem.
    The next part was to filter through the rule set for the rules which were considered "reachable".
The expected results were then able to be provided.
